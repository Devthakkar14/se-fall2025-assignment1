## üîß Next Steps (Manual Setup Required)

### 1. GitHub Repository
- Push all changes to your GitHub repository
- Ensure your repository is public or you have Travis CI Pro

### 2. Travis CI Setup
1. Go to [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com/)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Enable Travis CI for your repository
4. Update `.travis.yml` with your AWS EB details:
   - `app: your-app-name`
   - `env: your-app-env`
   - `bucket_name: your-eb-bucket`
   - `region: us-east-1` (or your region)

### 3. AWS Credentials
Add these environment variables in Travis CI settings:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` (from coveralls.io)

### 4. Coveralls Setup
1. Go to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Add your repository
4. Get the repository token

### 5. GitHub Branch Protection
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Select Travis CI checks

### 6. Update README Badges
Replace placeholders in `README.md`:
- `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`
- `YOUR_REPO_NAME`
- Update deployed application URL

## üß™ Local Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
./test_ci.sh
```

Or run individual commands:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Test formatting
black --check .

# Test linting
flake8 .

# Test Django
python manage.py test

# Test coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

## üìä Current Status

- ‚úÖ Code formatting: All files formatted with Black
- ‚úÖ Linting: No flake8 violations
- ‚úÖ Tests: 2 tests passing
- ‚úÖ Coverage: 72% coverage
- ‚è≥ Travis CI: Needs manual setup
- ‚è≥ AWS EB: Needs manual configuration
- ‚è≥ Coveralls: Needs manual setup

## üéØ Assignment Requirements Met

1. ‚úÖ Travis CI configuration file
2. ‚úÖ Black code formatting check
3. ‚úÖ Flake8 linting check
4. ‚úÖ Coverage.py and Coveralls setup
5. ‚úÖ README.md with badges (placeholders)
6. ‚úÖ Basic test suite
7. ‚úÖ AWS EB deployment configuration (needs your details)

## üìù Files to Submit

When ready, you'll need to provide:
1. **Travis CI Dashboard URL**: `https://travis-ci.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO`
2. **Deployed Application URL**: `https://your-app.elasticbeanstalk.com`
3. **GitHub Repository URL**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO`

## üö® Important Notes

- The `.travis.yml` file contains placeholders that need to be updated with your actual AWS EB details
- You need to set up AWS credentials in Travis CI environment variables
- Make sure your GitHub repository is connected to Travis CI
- Test with a pull request to verify branch protection works
